## Terra Component Library Developer Notes

#### Getting Started

- clone down the codebase - `git clone git@bitbucket.org:creativestrategy/terra-component-lib.git`
- cd into the new folder - `cd terra-component-lib`
- install dependencies - `npm install`
- run Storybook - `npm run storybook`

#### File Structure

The `src` folder contains most of what you'll be working with for the project.

- `/src/lib` - this folder will contain the component library in development as well as associated global styles.
- `/src/stories` - this folder will contain files related to storybook logic that we will need to write as we develop new components. See the examples in `/src/stories/index.js` for a general idea on syntax and logic required for this. Writing stories is pretty similar to writing React unit test, so once you're familiar with that, it shouldn't be too difficult to manage.

New components placed in `/src/lib` should be in their own folder with the following structure:

- `src/lib/[COMPONENT_NAME]/[COMPONENT_NAME].js`
- `src/lib/[COMPONENT_NAME]/[COMPONENT_NAME].scss`
- `src/lib/[COMPONENT_NAME]/[COMPONENT_NAME].test.js`

Once you've run a snapshot test on the component, it'll add an additional snapshot directory and file to the component directory:

- `src/lib/[COMPONENT_NAME]/__snapshots__/[COMPONENT_NAME].test.js.snap`

##### Adding a Component to the Library

All components ready to ship should be imported into `/dist/index.js` and then exported from within to be easily accessible once bundled. This file will act as the hub for all component library importing. Example:

`import Alert from "./components/Alert/Alert";`
`export { Alert }`

##### Folders to ignore

- `.storybook` - this directory is setup simply for storybook configuration and can be ignored.
- `public` - this directory is generally used for housing images and the main user-facing `index.html` file, but as this is a component library and not an actual application, we won't be concerned with this.

#### Storybook

Storybook is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation for React and other popular JavaScript frameworks. It makes building UIs organized and efficient. Stories are written in `src/stories/index.js` with a syntax not unlike common JavaScript unit tests. See the [Storybook docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/) for more information on how to use the Storybook API.

If you prefer a simpler sandbox approach, you can simply import your components into `App.js` like normal and manually test them there.

#### Testing Methodology

To run the test suite, use `npm test`. To check for test coverage, use `npm test -- --coverage`. Avoid making PRs on components with less than 100% coverage if possible. Non JavaScript files or files that are not placed in `./src/lib/components` will be ignored by the test suite, so be mindful of where you create files if you want them tested. If you would like to add files to the coverage report that are outside these folders, add a path to these files in `package.json` in the `collectCoverageFrom` array.

You can find links to Medium articles on the most common types of tests for this library in the Resources and Libraries section of this document.

#### Prop Type Verification

This library uses the propTypes library for type checking and for developer error messaging on required props. All components with props should import the module using:

`import PropTypes from "prop-types";`

Prop type checking should happen at the bottom of the file, below the export statement. Any specific prop that is required to make a component minimally function will need to have the `.isRequired` in their value.

###### Example: Deep Type-Checking Objects -

```
Object.propTypes = {
  button: PropTypes.shape({
    onClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
    text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    className: PropTypes.string.isRequired
  }),
};
```

###### Example: Deep Type-Checking Arrays -

```
Array.propTypes = {
  ourArray: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.string).isRequired
}
```

</br>
Components that do not use props do not need to use the prop-types API.

#### Creating a Build

To run the build process, run `npm run build`. This will delete any existing builds in the directory and create a new one in the root labeled `/dist`. This folder will contain all our components, the `index.js` for easy access once the package is imported into a project, and all our style data.

The library bundling is done using Babel with `@babel/core` and `@babel/cli` as dependencies. Note that installing normal `babel-cli` will not work with this library as it has been bootstrapped with Create React App 2.0 (this caused a great deal of problems and confusion in initially getting the build process working).

#### Deploying the Build

To deploy a build to npm, you first need to login from the command line with `npm login`. Consult Brandon White for credentials. After you've successfully logged in, deploy the project to npm using `npm deploy`. This will take the bundled `dist` folder and upload it to npm.

#### Importing Terra Component Library into a Project

To install the library into a project, use `npm i --save terra-component-lib`. Import individual components by destructuring them. Example:

`import { Button } from 'terra-component-lib';`

Then simply call the component inside your JSX and pass in the necessary props:

`<Button text="Button" onClick={this.handleClick} className="ter-button--primary--1" />`

- [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) - You can use prop-types to document the intended types of properties passed to components. React will check props passed to your components against those definitions, and warn in development if they donâ€™t match. This is important for developer empathy when importing and using the library.
